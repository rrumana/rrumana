ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rrumana. I lost my last Github account because was tied to a school email so I figured I'd make a new one.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested honing my skills and contributing towards open source projects whenever possible. I'm learning Rust right now and plan to learn more languages soon.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI and advanced algorithms, but I'll post everything I make here regardless of category.

ğŸ“« You can reach me at ryan.rumana@gmail.com
