👋 Hi, I’m @rrumana. I lost my last Github account because was tied to a school email so I figured I'd make a new one.

👀 I’m interested honing my skills and contributing towards open source projects whenever possible. i'M LEARNING Rust right now and plan to learn more languages soon.

🌱 I’m currently learning AI and advanced algorithms, but I'll post everything I make here regardless of category.
